    Program ........ Cacti Data Source Statistics Plugin
    Version ........ 1.4
    Purpose ........ Collects Last Values for all Cacti Data Source.  Also
                     collects Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly Peaks and 
                     Averages for All Cacti Data Sources

*******************************************************************************/


----[ Purpose

    This plugin is designed to allow Cacti plugin developers the architecture
    to graph a larger variety of data, as well as to support a whole new
    class of graph types.
    
    From the data provided by this plugin, the following graph concepts can
    be implented:
    
    1) Show top ten hosts by cpu utilization
    2) Show the average load average for a rack of hardware
    3) Show the most utilized set of remote access links in a city or state
    4) Show the total network traffic in a data center
    5) Show the average cpu temperature in a rack of equipment
    6) Create a set of rules that define a poorly performing host and
       display that in a dashboard
    
    It enables all these possibilities and more.  I will leave it to the
    plugin developer to figure out how.  This plugin provides simply the
    framework to extend Cacti and not the GUI that makes managers happy.

----[ Features

    Simply, Tracks Average and Peak values for all Data Sources for the
    following time periods:
    
    Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly
    
    If only maintains the current average, you still need to goto the 
    RRDFile, or the graph, if you wish to see anything other than
    last.
