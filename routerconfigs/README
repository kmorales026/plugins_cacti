----[ Purpose

	This plugin is for the nightly backup of Router Configs

----[ Features

	Nightly Backup
	Configurable User accounts per device
	Keeps each backup for a configurable number of days
	Can compare and display the exact differences between any 2 configs	
		
----[ Installation

	Requires TFTP server on the Cacti box
	For CentOS, just run these commands (remove the #)

		# yum install tftp-server

		The edit the tftp startup script (/etc/xinetd.d/tftp) to change the server
		arguments, I used this line
			server_args		= -c -s /home/configs/backups
		You will need to create this folder (or whatever folder you specify) and give
		the apache server and the tftp server permissions to access it

		I have provided a copy of this file for you.  Then we just need to turn on
		the tftp server so do this.

		# chkconfig xinetd on
		# service xinetd start

	There are a few options in Cacti you will need to change to then get the plugin up
	and running.  They are located under Settings >> Misc >> Router Configs
		>> TFTP Server IP = The IP Address of the Cacti server given to the routers
		>> Backup Directory Path = The directory you put in the TFTP file above

	Now you should be good to go, just add an authenication account, and a device and it
	will download the first backup after a few pollings.

----[ Possible Bugs?
   
	Only Cisco IOS and CatOS Routers are currently supported
	If you find a problem, let me know!!! http://cactiusers.org/bugs/

----[ Future Changes

	SNMP Traps to allow automatic backup of routers after every change
	Auto-detection of router type
	HTML Frames around compare windows to allow highlighting of the config
    
	Got any ideas or complaints, please e-mail me!
