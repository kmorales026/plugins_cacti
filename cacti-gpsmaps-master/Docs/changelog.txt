-Enter Hosts Lat & Long in host settings

Version 1.01

Version 1.3
6/11/2009

-Implemented PIA 2.x standards
-Fixed partially, Bug when performing an IP analysis and no IP address is specified in hostname area. Currently it will not display those devices.
-Fixed some minor inconsistancies involing the XML output to google maps.
-Ensured that install/uninstall works and removed database columns

Version 1.31
-Alot of changes in preparation for the addition of circle overlays for coverage. 
-Created a base to work from

Version 1.32
-Made for the addition of static circles on simple points based on lat/long
-Started work on how to get distance from tower bases. 
-most of the PHP for the coverage XML has been written

Version 1.33
-Found some math errors and corrected
-First dynamic plotting of overlay done. 
-Modified the coverage XML to make each tower an object and treat them as such. 
-(speculation on the use of objects for the IP analysis)

Version 1.34
-Allowed for towers in the same IP range to graph a circle. This might not be the best way to approach this issue.
But seeing that there is no way to get actual connected subscribers, IP range is the only way to do this.

Version 1.35
-Increated float range in database for increased accuracy. Up to 13 characters for Lat/Long now
-removed the integer conversions in code to increase accurrcy
-Added customizable options in the settings.

Version 1.36
-Fixed bug that mistakenly displayed incorrect towers and nodes when in regular mode.
-Fixed bug that displayed all towers no matter what IP range settings when in coverage mode.
-Changed the way the IP Region adds to an array. This is to make it a dynamic array and decrease wasted space.

Version 1.37
-Fixed bug that would have multiple overlays for one tower, each overlay being a different size.
-Fixed bug that would keep towers from overlaying proper distance.
-Fixed When multiple points were on the same IP range they could potentially have a circle drawn about them, if conditions were right.
-Added multiple AP Overlay mode. This is to allow multiple overlays per IP range. By default it only allows one overlay per IP range. (Ip range is defined as the 192.168.XXX.YYY Where XXX differs between ranges)
-Added link to the host graphs from the icon pop-up.
-Will only display ENABLED hosts. Will add the option later to display all hosts.

Version 1.4
-Complete overhaul of the Host/Tower management. Moved over to an object oriented design that effectively reduced the amount of database calls at minimum of half. This should speed up the displaying of the map.
-The top grey bar now dynamically sizes to the height of the text.
-The final IP analysis area displays all IP address for that range, this links to that hosts graphs. This can make a problem of having multiple rows of grey bars with IP addresses. Looking for solutions.
-A maximum of 6 IP address will be stacked before moving onto the next column. 
-In the GPSMap settings, I have made simpler the setup of the tower Host ID. Just select the template that is being used by your towers/APs.
-New Towers Only mode selectable in the settings, guess what it does? Thats right, displays on the towers. It can also display coverage maps
-Added a print button. DOES NOT PRINT OVERLAY. Takes a little bit of guess work to get a pic of what you want, but at least it works.
-Made map navigation to a full nav bar. It got annoying just using the (+) and (-) buttons.

Version 1.41
-Added the UP/Down/Recovery viewing. Hosts change color based on status. Colors correspond to cacti designated colors.
-Added the ability to display disabled hosts. These wil show up as BLACK markers to ensure that a difference can be seen.
-Added a preliminary test for overlaying current radar information. Take a look at the Weather.php file for more info.
-Modified the navigation to allow for mouse wheel usage.

*Yeah... forgot to update the changelog for all of the changes. So v1.5 because it is a major update
Version 1.5
-Weather has been disabled. Some code is still left in there for the prying people
-KML exportin is fully supported
-Templates for up/down/recover have been set
-GPS maps outputs the templates and set colors and images accordingly.
-I havent fully fixed the setup database script yet, so...there will need some work
-Added a few parameters to the host class to accomodate the changes
-So long as original server accepts connections Google earth should get custom images.
-Still small bug with the console always being red
-Removed the custom hosts file, it is no longer needed.
-Several new files, to accomodate GUI updates
-A big thanks to the thold plugin for helping me out.

Version 1.51

-Minor bugfixes, there was one leftover <php= VAR ?> left around
-some small tweaks to the KMLcreation file to prevent errors on 0 indexes.
-small fix to remove some pulled settings.

Version 1.62
-Changed the processing of points. 
-Reduced some DB queries by half.
-Thanks to Nate for the tabs
http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Maps-API/browse_thread/thread/b023708935be9392/ae9ca67ef4e8b136%3Fshow_docid=ae9ca67ef4e8b136
-Nodes close to each other are grouped into tabs. There is a threashold setting for this. 
-One bud is that the nodes put into the tabs are not removed form the map.
-In Map template creator. You can now edit the tamplates.
-Allowed for Multiple host types to be designated as APs
-Hides AP options when not applicable to the device.
-Customizable refresh interval
-Can define a group for each device. All devices by default are in group 0.
-Can set the angle of the overlay to have a directed overlay map
-Automatic Overlays will only use the devices in their group to determine distance.
-If you dont want automatic radius distance, you can directly control the radius of the overlay around a single AP
-Changed several DB Columns to Decimal instead of Float for greater precision
-Thanks to Niobe, the annoying bug that dealt with the GPSMaps tab not turning read has been fixed.
-Map is now almost full screen due to fix.
-The 1.6 code base in general has been rewritten and sorted out to provide easier following of execution path.
-******CAUTION********
-Version 1.62 is more PIA standards compliant! This means if you uninstall the plugin IT WILL REMOVE YOUR GPS DATA.
-Always backup your database before installing or removing this plugin!
-******CAUTION********
-Sorry for the long wait!


Version 1.63
-Emergency update.

-All icons are contained within the images\icons folder

-Fixed bug where coverage overlays would eat up RAM by causing a invalid for loop.


Version 1.7
-Redesigned how XML and KML files are created.
-Files are created on poller hit
-Created both KML and XML files for each level.
-Monitor certain levels of subnets by picking appropriate file. Useful for NOC who only needs supervision of certain subnet
-Overlay is computed each cycle, toggle is in the settings
-Error checking for correct GPS coordinates entry, coordinate will default to 0.0000 if error is found SQL does some checking, ran against regex to be sure
-Lots of redundant code from 1.63 has been removed.
-Direct links to XML and KML have been added next to the subnet

Version 1.8

- Replacement of GMarker.openInfoWindowTabsHtml with the InfoBubble library made by Luke Mahe : http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobubble/
- Google Maps API key is no longer required, GPSMap setting pannel has been updated in consequence
- Almost all of the Javascript code is moved in the /js/GPSMaps.js file
- A Javascript namespace "gpsmap" is created in order to avoid global variables and conflict with others libraries
- GPL licence version 2 is added to the files structure
- A GPL licence summary is added in each source code file
