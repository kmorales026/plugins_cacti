    Program ........ Fix 64bit Counters
    Version ........ 0.4
    Purpose ........ Easily convert 32bit interface traffic graphs to 64bit graphs

**********************************************************************************/


----[ Purpose

    Provides a method convert 32bit interface traffic graphs to 64bit graphs by
    one click on the icon near the needed graph.

    Could be used to change other inputs for other graphs, but wasn't yet tested.

----[ Installation

    Install like any other plugin, just throw it in the plugin directory,
    in a folder called, for example, fix64bit.

    Enable it in Plugin Management, set rights to users in User Management.

    Go in Settings/Misc, verify "Fix 64bit Counters" parameters,  hit  Save  and
    you are ready to go.

----[ Usage

    After plugin install you can see icon fix64bit near the graph you can convert
    (this icon will not appear near graphs that are incompatible or already converted).

    Click on that icon, popup window will appear. If there are any possible problems
    with conversion, you will see them in that window.

    If everything is correct, confirm conversion by clicking on “Yes” button.

    Also you can choose graphs to convert in the “Graph Management” page. Just select 
    needed graphs, choose a “Fix 64bit Counters” action in dropdown and hit “Ok”. 
    If graphs could not be converted, you will receive corresponding message and 
    when you press “Continue” it will fix all the graphs that it can fix.

    Fixing process is performed after the next run of poller (this is due to the need
    to edit rrd file), so 64bit counters are begin to work only after two polls.

    Verification is rather thorough, plugin checks SNMP version (it should be 2 or greater)
    and every SNMP query constraints.
