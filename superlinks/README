SuperLinks 1.4
===============

----[ Purpose

   This plugin is an extension of my Links plugin with some important new features:
     * It supports ANY number of extra tabs
     * It will dynamically create the Tab graphics as pages are created
     * It has the same user-based access-control as Weathermap
     * It allows you to add new links to the Console menu as well as tabs
       and also blocks of content to the 'Welcome' front page.
     * Allows you to directly embed another website/application without writing any HTML

----[ Installation

   Just as any other Cacti plugin - unzip into your plugins folder, and Install and
   Enable from Plugin Management.

   Make sure that the plugins/superlinks/content directory is writable by your
   webserver user. The SuperLinks management page will warn you if this is
   not correct.

   NOTE: SuperLinks also requires the 'gd' php module and the related GD library (or DLL).
   It also requires that GD was built with PNG support and Freetype support.

----[ Directions

   Go into Cacti's User Management and give yourself permission to Manage and View SuperLinks Pages.

   Copy some HTML fragments into the plugins/superlinks/content/ directory

   Go to Cacti's Console menu, and Management..SuperLinks Pages

   Choose Add, and then pick a file from the content/ list. You can then choose the name of the
   Tab or Menu Item, and which of those it will be.

   Click on the username in the 'Acccesible By' column to change which users are allowed to see
   this particular page. Tabs will disappear for other users.

----[ Notes

   The files in content/ should NOT be complete HTML files - they should have no HEAD or BODY tags.
   Only the stuff that would normally appear inside <body>.  There are 3 example files in the 
   directory already.
